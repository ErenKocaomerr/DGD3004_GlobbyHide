Game Overview: This game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with a strong focus on
stealth and atmosphere. The player controls a misunderstood legendary creature navigating
a dark urban environment. The experience is designed to be short and focused, with an
estimated playtime of around thirty minutes. The game is developed for PC as a single-player
experience.

High Concept: At its core, the game explores the idea that not every monster is evil.
Although feared by the people of the city, the main character secretly helps them by
listening to their problems and acting without being seen. Progression is driven by
exploration, stealth, and understanding rather than combat.

Core Gameplay Loop: The player moves through platforming spaces while
avoiding bounty hunters. When NPCs are encountered, the player can secretly listen to
their conversations, which leads to a transition into a minigame scene. Completing
minigames allows the player to continue progressing through the world.

Player Mechanics: Movement mechanics include walking, jumping, dashing, and
double jumping once unlocked. The hiding mechanic allows the player to merge with
darkness, making them invisible to enemies. There is no ledge grabbing or wall climbing,
keeping the movement system simple and readable.

Enemies and Stealth: Enemies consist of bounty hunters that patrol predefined
routes and react to suspicious behavior. In addition, flying lamps are deployed to search
elevated areas and temporarily illuminate dark zones, forcing the player to adapt their
movement and hiding strategies.

Minigame System: The game features a total of six minigames, each played in a
separate scene. Minigames are triggered after listening to NPC conversations and

represent the act of understanding and responding to their problems. Failure does not end
the game but alters subsequent challenges.

Legendary Spirits and Progression: Three legendary spirits are hidden
throughout the game world. Each spirit permanently unlocks a new ability for the player,
such as hiding, dash, or double jump. These abilities expand traversal options and form the
backbone of player progression.

Narrative Design Narrative: delivery is minimal and atmospheric. The player
character does not speak in words, using unintelligible sounds instead. Story elements are
communicated through environmental cues and short, contextual dialogue moments. Only
the opening sequence uses a cinematic presentation.

Art and Audio Direction: The art style is hand-drawn with a dark, moody palette
inspired by decaying urban spaces. Audio design focuses on ambient sounds such as wind,
distant movement, and muffled voices to reinforce tension and immersion.

Project Scope: The final project includes three main gameplay areas, six minigames,
and three unlockable abilities. The overall scope is intentionally compact, prioritizing
polish, atmosphere, and mechanical clarity.
